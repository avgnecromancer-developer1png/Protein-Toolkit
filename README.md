# Protein-Toolkit
A Python-based DNA toolkit helps transcribe an input DNA sequence into RNA and translate it into a protein sequence. The program counts the frequency of nucleotide bases, provides the sequence length, calculates the GC content percentage, and generates the complement and reverse complement of the input DNA sequence.
