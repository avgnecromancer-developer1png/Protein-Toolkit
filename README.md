# Protein-Toolkit
A Python-based DNA toolkit helps transcribe an input DNA sequence into RNA and translate it into a protein sequence. The program counts the frequency of nucleotide bases, provides the sequence length, calculates the GC content percentage, and generates the complement and reverse complement of the input DNA sequence.

# Purpose
⦁	To know frequency of nucleotide bases (A,G,C,T)
⦁	It will give Complement and Reverse Complement of input DNA
⦁	To convert DNA sequence into PROTEIN seq.
⦁	To convert input DNA sequence into RNA
⦁	GC content present in a sequence

# Benefits
⦁	It will help to understand the sequence in detail
⦁	This Python program can be used by students in universities and colleges in their basic biological research work.
